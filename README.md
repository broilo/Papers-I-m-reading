  ### Data lake:

   *A data lake is a system or repository of data stored in its natural/raw format, usually object blobs or files. Usually It's a single store of all enterprise data including raw copies of source system data and transformed data used for tasks such as reporting, visualization, advanced analytics and machine learning. Moreover a  data lake also can include structured data from relational databases (rows and columns), semi-structured data (CSV, logs, XML, JSON), unstructured data (emails, documents, PDFs) and binary data (images, audio, video). It can be established "on premises" (within an organization's data centers) or "in the cloud" (using cloud services from vendors such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft). **A data swamp** is a deteriorated and unmanaged data lake that is either inaccessible to its intended users or is providing little value.*
